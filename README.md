# video-to-audio-converter
Converting mp4 videos to mp3 in a microservices architecture.

 utilized AWS EKS service to set up a node group. In the configuration, I adjusted the inbound rules by including access to ports 30002, 30003, 30004, and 30005. These ports are designated for accessing gateway, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ and mongodb services

### Commands

Here are some essential Kubernetes commands for managing your deployment:


### MongoDB

To install MongoDB, set the database username and password in `values.yaml`, then navigate to the MongoDB Helm chart folder and run:

```
cd Helm_charts/MongoDB
helm install mongo .
```

Connect to the MongoDB instance using:

```
mongosh mongodb://<username>:<pwd>@<nodeip>:30005/mp3s?authSource=admin
```

### PostgreSQL

Set the database username and password in `values.yaml`. Install PostgreSQL from the PostgreSQL Helm chart folder and initialize it with the queries in `init.sql`. For PowerShell users:

```
cd ..
cd Postgres
helm install postgres .
```

Connect to the Postgres database and copy all the queries from the "init.sql" file.
```
psql 'postgres://<username>:<pwd>@<nodeip>:30003/authdb'
```

### RabbitMQ

Deploy RabbitMQ by running:

```
helm install rabbitmq .
```

Ensure you have created two queues in RabbitMQ named `mp3` and `video`. To create queues, visit `<nodeIp>:30004>` and use default username `guest` and password `guest`

**NOTE:** Ensure that all the necessary ports are open in the node security group.

### Apply the manifest file for each microservice:

- **Auth Service:**
  ```
  cd auth-service/manifest
  kubectl apply -f .
  ```

- **Gateway Service:**
  ```
  cd gateway-service/manifest
  kubectl apply -f .
  ```

- **Converter Service:**
  ```
  cd converter-service/manifest
  kubectl apply -f .
  ```

- **Notification Service:**
  ```
  cd notification-service/manifest
  kubectl apply -f .
  ```

### Application Validation

After deploying the microservices, verify the status of all components by running:

```
kubectl get all
```

### Notification Configuration



For configuring email notifications and two-factor authentication (2FA), follow these steps:

1. Go to your Gmail account and click on your profile.

2. Click on "Manage Your Google Account."

3. Navigate to the "Security" tab on the left side panel.

4. Enable "2-Step Verification."

5. Search for the application-specific passwords. You will find it in the settings.

6. Click on "Other" and provide your name.

7. Click on "Generate" and copy the generated password.

8. Paste this generated password in `notification/manifest/secret.yaml` along with your email.

Run the application through the following API calls:

# API Definition

- **Login Endpoint**
  ```http request
  POST http://nodeIP:30002/login
  ```

  ```console
  curl -X POST http://nodeIP:30002/login -u <email>:<password>
  ``` 
  Expected output: success!

- **Upload Endpoint**


  ```console
   curl -X POST -F 'file=@./video.mp4' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <JWT Token>' http://nodeIP:30002/upload
  ``` 
  
  Check if you received the ID on your email.

- **Download Endpoint**

  ```console
   curl --output video.mp3 -X GET -H 'Authorization: Bearer <JWT Token>' "http://nodeIP:30002/download?fid=<Generated fid>"
  ```
